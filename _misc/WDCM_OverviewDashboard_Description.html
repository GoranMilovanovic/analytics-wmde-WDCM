<h4>Introduction<h4>
    <br>
    <p><font size = 2>This Dashboard is a part of the Wikidata Concepts Monitor (WDMC). The WDCM system provides analytics on Wikidata usage
      across the client projects. The WDCM Overview Dashboard presents the big picture of Wikidata usage; other WDCM dashboards go
      into more detail.</font></p>

<h4>Wikidata Item Usage Definition</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2><b>NOTE.</b> The current Wikidata item usage statistic definition is <i>the count of the number of pages in a particular client project
    where the respective Wikidata item is used</i>. Thus, the current definition ignores the usage aspects completely</font></p>

<h4>Wikidata Usage Overview</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2>The similarity structure in Wikidata usage <i>across the client projects</i> is presented. Each bubble represents a client project.
    The size of the bubble reflects the volume of Wikidata usage in the respective project. Projects similar in respect to the semantics of Wikidata
    usage are grouped together. Only top five projects (of each project type) in respect to Wikidata usage volume are labeled.<br>
    The bubble chart is produced by performing a t-SNE dimensionality reduction of the inter-Projects Euclidean distances derived from the
    Projects x Categories contingency table.</font></p>

<h4>Wikidata Usage Tendency</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2>The similarity structure in Wikidata usage <i>across the semantic categories</i> is presented. Each bubble represents a Wikidata semantic
    category. The size of the bubble reflects the volume of Wikidata usage from the respective category. If two categories are found in proximity,
    that means that the projects that tend to use the one also tend to use the another, and vice versa.<br>
    The bubble chart is produced by performing a t-SNE dimensionality reduction of the inter-Projects Euclidean distances derived from the
    Categories x Projects contingency table.</font></p>

<h4>Wikidata Usage Distribution</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2>The plots are helpful to build an understanding of the relative range of Wikidata usage across the client projects.
    In the <i>Project Usage Rank-Frequency</i> plot, each point represents a client project; Wikidata usage is represented on the vertical and
    the project usage rank on the horizontal axis, while only top project (per project type) are labeled. The highly-skewed, asymmetrical
    distribution reveals that a small fraction of client projects only accounts for a huge proportion of Wikidata usage.<br> In the
  <i>Project Usage log(Rank)-log(Frequency)</i> plot, the logarithms of both variables are represented. A power-law relationship holds true if this
  plot is linear; the plot includes the best fit linear model, however, no attempts to estimate the Zipf distribution were made. </font></p>
  <hr>
<h4>Client Project Types</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2>Project types are provided in the rows of this chart, while the semantic categories are given on the horizontal axis.
  The height of the respective bar indicates Wikidata usage from the respective semantic category in a particular client project.</font></p>
  <hr>
<h4>Client Projects Usage Volume</h4>
  <br>
  <p><font size = 2>Use the slider to select the percent range of the Wikidata usage distribution across the client project to show. The
  chart will automatically adjust presenting the selected projects in increasing order of Wikidata usage, presenting at most 30 top projects
  from the selection.</font></p>
